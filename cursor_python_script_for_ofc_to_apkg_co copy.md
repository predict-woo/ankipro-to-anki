I'm trying to create a python script that converts ankipro's .ofc files into anki's .apkg files. 

anki's ofc files are constructed as follows

**Cursor**

Okay, I can help you create a Python script to convert AnkiPro's `.ofc` files into Anki's `.apkg` files.

First, I need to understand the structure of an `.apkg` file and how to create one. I'll search the web for this information, focusing on Python libraries that might simplify the process, such as the `genanki` library.

The search results confirm that `genanki` is a popular and well-documented Python library for creating Anki decks and packages (`.apkg` files). The basic workflow involves:

1.  **Defining a Model**: This specifies the fields (e.g., 'Question', 'Answer', 'MyMedia') and card templates (how the fields are displayed on the front and back of cards). Each model needs a unique ID.
2.  **Creating Notes**: Each note represents a piece of information and is associated with a model. You provide the field content for each note. Notes also have GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) which are important for updating existing notes.
3.  **Creating a Deck**: A deck is a collection of notes. It also requires a unique ID.
4.  **Adding Media (Optional)**: If your notes include images or audio, you list these files when creating the package. The notes then reference these media files using specific HTML tags (e.g., `<img src="filename.png">`).
5.  **Creating a Package**: This bundles the deck(s) and media files into an `.apkg` file.

Now, let's outline the steps for your conversion script:

**Script Plan:**

1.  **Input**: The script will take the path to the `.ofc` file (or the unzipped directory) as input.
2.  **Unzipping**:
    *   Unzip the main `.ofc` file (which is a zip archive).
    *   Locate `attachments.zip` within the unzipped contents and unzip it into an `attachments` folder (if it's not already unzipped).
3.  **Parsing Metadata**:
    *   Read `deck_export_metadata.json` to get the deck name.
4.  **Parsing Deck Data**:
    *   Decompress `deck_export_data` (which is zstd compressed) to get the JSON content.
    *   Parse this JSON data. It appears to be a list of decks, each containing notes.
5.  **Using `genanki`**:
    *   For each deck in the AnkiPro data:
        *   Create a `genanki.Model`. We'll need to define a standard model structure. Based on the `deck_export_data_decompressed` example, a "Front Side" and "Back Side" field seems appropriate. We'll also need a field for media if attachments are present.
        *   Create a `genanki.Deck` using the name from the metadata.
        *   Iterate through the `notes` in the AnkiPro deck data:
            *   Extract the "front\_side" and "back\_side" content.
            *   Handle HTML content: The AnkiPro fields seem to contain HTML (`<p>`, `<strong>`, `<ul>`, `<li>`). `genanki` expects HTML for fields.
            *   Process `note_attachments`:
                *   If a note has attachments, construct the correct HTML `<img>` tag. The `media_file.url` seems to provide a URL, but for local `.apkg` files, we need to use local filenames. We'll need to extract the filename from the URL (e.g., `a6aedbc3-ba4a-4841-b8de-d074b9a651df.png`) and ensure this file is in our `media_files` list for the package. The `field_name` (e.g., "back\_side") indicates where the image should be appended.
            *   Create a `genanki.Note` with the extracted fields.
            *   Add the note to the `genanki.Deck`.
    *   Collect all attachment filenames (e.g., `024afc39-d8b6-487a-96fb-e26dfeae9eff.png`) to be included in `my_package.media_files`. These files should be at the root of where Anki expects media, so we'll need to make sure the paths are relative and correct.
    *   Create a `genanki.Package` with the deck(s) and the list of media file paths.
    *   Write the package to an `.apkg` file.
6.  **Required Libraries**:
    *   `zipfile` (for unzipping)
    *   `zstandard` (for decompressing `deck_export_data`) - This will need to be installed (`pip install zstandard`).
    *   `json` (for parsing JSON)
    *   `genanki` (for creating the `.apkg` file) - This will need to be installed (`pip install genanki`).
    *   `os` and `shutil` (for file and directory manipulation).
    *   `random` (for generating unique IDs for models and decks, as recommended by `genanki`).
    *   `html` (for escaping HTML if necessary, though it seems the input is already HTML).

**File Structure Handling:**

The script will need to handle the input `.ofc` file. A good approach would be:

1.  Create a temporary directory.
2.  Unzip the `.ofc` file into this temporary directory.
3.  If `attachments.zip` exists, unzip it into `temporary_directory/folder_name/attachments/`.
4.  Process the files from this temporary directory structure.
5.  Clean up the temporary directory afterwards.

Let's start by creating the main script structure and the functions for unzipping and parsing. I will create a file named `ofc_to_apkg_converter.py`.

```python
import zipfile
import zstandard
import json
import os
import shutil

# It's important to use unique IDs. Generate them once and hardcode them.
# python -c "import random; print(random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31))"
DEFAULT_MODEL_ID = random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31) # Or hardcode a generated one
DEFAULT_DECK_ID = random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31)  # Or hardcode a generated one

ANKI_MODEL = genanki.Model(
    DEFAULT_MODEL_ID,
    'AnkiPro Imported Model',
    fields=[
        {'name': 'Front'},
        {'name': 'Back'},
        # Potentially add a dedicated media field if needed,
        # but appending to Front/Back is also common.
    ],
    templates=[

I've created the initial Python script `ofc_to_apkg_converter.py`. It includes:

*   Imports for necessary libraries (`zipfile`, `zstandard`, `json`, `os`, `shutil`, `random`, `genanki`, `tempfile`, `argparse`, `urllib.parse`).
*   Placeholder `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` and `DEFAULT_DECK_ID` (it's better to generate these once and hardcode them for consistency, or derive them from the input data if possible).
*   A basic `ANKI_MODEL` definition with 'Front' and 'Back' fields.
*   A `process_ofc_file` function that:
    *   Handles both `.ofc` file (by unzipping to a temporary directory) and direct directory input.
    *   Extracts attachments from `attachments.zip` if present and not already extracted.
    *   Reads `deck_export_metadata.json`.
    *   Decompresses and parses `deck_export_data`.
    *   Iterates through the deck(s) and notes from the AnkiPro data.
    *   Extracts "front\_side" and "back\_side" for each note.
    *   Processes `note_attachments` to include `<img>` tags in the appropriate fields and collects media file paths. The `media_files` for the `genanki.Package` must be a list of *actual paths* to the files on disk, so `genanki` can copy them into the `.apkg`. The `<img>` tags in the note fields must use just the filename.
    *   Creates `genanki.Note` and `genanki.Deck` objects.
    *   Creates a `genanki.Package` and writes it to the specified output `.apkg` file.
    *   Includes media files in the package.
*   A `main` function to handle command-line arguments for input and output paths.
*   An `extract_filename_from_url` helper to get filenames from media URLs.
*   A `generate_guid` placeholder. Using the AnkiPro note ID for GUIDs would be good for idempotency if users re-import/update decks. For now, it lets `genanki` auto-generate them.

**Next Steps & Considerations:**

1.    **Testing with Real Data**: The script needs to be tested with your actual `.ofc` file structure and data to catch any discrepancies between the assumed format and the real format.
    *   The current script assumes `deck_export_data_decompressed` contains a list of "deck" objects, and each of these has a "notes" list. If the structure is different (e.g., the outer list *is* the notes, or there's always only one deck defined implicitly by `deck_export_metadata.json`), the parsing loop `for ap_deck_data in ankipro_decks_data:` and how `anki_deck` is initialized will need adjustment.
    *   Based on your `deck_export_data_decompressed` snippet, the top-level element is a list `[]`, and the first (and only) element of that list is a dictionary representing a single deck (with keys `id`, `name`, `notes`, `settings`). The script currently iterates `ankipro_decks_data` which is this list. This seems correct.
2.  **GUIDs**: For better Anki integration (especially for updating notes instead of creating duplicates), using a stable GUID is recommended. The `id` field from the AnkiPro notes (`note_data['id']`) would be a good candidate.
    I've updated the `generate_guid` function to simply return `genanki.guid_for(str(note_data['id']))` to use the AnkiPro note ID for GUID generation. This is generally a good idea.

    Let's refine the GUID generation.
    

```python

3.  **Error Handling and Robustness**: More error checks can be added (e.g., what if `fields` or specific field names are missing?).
4.  **Model Customization**: The Anki model (`ANKI_MODEL`) is currently basic. If AnkiPro notes have more structured data that you want to map to different Anki fields, the model definition and field mapping logic would need to be expanded. The current `css` field in AnkiPro notes is ignored; if this contains useful styling, it could potentially be added to the `genanki.Model`'s `css` argument.
5.  **Hardcoded IDs**: For `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` and `DEFAULT_DECK_ID`, it's best practice to generate these once (e.g., using `python -c "import random; print(random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31))"`) and then hardcode those specific numbers in the script. This ensures that if you re-run the script for the same conceptual deck/model, Anki recognizes them as the same. I've added comments about this.

The script should now be in a good state to start testing. Remember to install the necessary libraries:
`pip install genanki zstandard`

You would run the script from your terminal like this:
`python ofc_to_apkg_converter.py /path/to/your/deck.ofc /path/to/your/output.apkg`
or, if you've already unzipped the `.ofc` file:
`python ofc_to_apkg_converter.py /path/to/unzipped_ofc_folder /path/to/your/output.apkg`

Let me know how the testing goes or if you have specific parts of the AnkiPro data structure you'd like to handle differently!

decompression doesnt work for some reason. I tried renaming .ofc to .zip then using unzip comand and this works. why?

---

**Cursor**

You're right to point that out! The manual `unzip` command output is key here:
```
Archive:  seperation_techniques_2025_05_22_144559.zip
  inflating: deck_export_data        
  inflating: deck_export_metadata.json  
  inflating: attachments.zip
```
This shows that the contents (`deck_export_data`, `deck_export_metadata.json`, `attachments.zip`) are extracted directly into the target folder, *not* into an intermediate subfolder named `seperation_techniques_2025_05_22_144559/`.

The Python script, however, was making an assumption:
```python
            # .ofc files have a single root directory after unzipping <--- This assumption was incorrect
            extracted_folders = [
                os.path.join(temp_dir, name)
                for name in os.listdir(temp_dir)
                if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(temp_dir, name))
            ]
            if not extracted_folders:
                print(f"Error: No directory found after unzipping '{ofc_path}'.") # <--- This is why you got the error
                return
            base_path = extracted_folders[0] 
```
It was unzipping to a temporary directory (`temp_dir`) and then looking for *another* directory inside `temp_dir` to use as the `base_path`. Since your `.ofc` file extracts its contents flatly, no such subdirectory was found, leading to the error.

The fix is to use `temp_dir` itself as the `base_path` when an `.ofc` file is unzipped, because the files are directly there.

I'll make this correction in the `process_ofc_file` function.

            ]

                print(f"Error: No directory found after unzipping '{ofc_path}'.") # <--- This is why you got the error
                return
            base_path = extracted_folders[0] 
```

```python

            with zipfile.ZipFile(ofc_path, "r") as zip_ref:
                zip_ref.extractall(temp_dir)

            # .ofc files have a single root directory after unzipping
            # MODIFICATION: Assume files are extracted directly into temp_dir
            # extracted_folders = [
            #     os.path.join(temp_dir, name)
            #     for name in os.listdir(temp_dir)
            #     if os.path.isdir(os.path.join(temp_dir, name))
            # ]
            # if not extracted_folders:
            #     print(f"Error: No directory found after unzipping '{ofc_path}'.")
            #     if temp_dir: # Ensure cleanup if error occurs here
            #         shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)
            #     return
            # base_path = extracted_folders[
            #     0
            # ]  # Assume the first directory is the one we need
            base_path = temp_dir # Files are extracted directly into temp_dir

        except zipfile.BadZipFile:
            print(
// ... existing code ...
```

This change should resolve the "No directory found after unzipping" error. The `base_path` will now correctly point to the temporary directory where `deck_export_data`, `deck_export_metadata.json`, and `attachments.zip` are located.

The reason `unzip` worked after renaming to `.zip` is that `.ofc` files are indeed standard zip archives. The Python `zipfile` library also treats them as such. The issue wasn't with the *ability* to decompress, but with the script's subsequent (and incorrect) expectation of an extra directory layer.

@ofc_to_apkg_converter.py  hmm. instead of using attachments inside the zip, can you just download it from the url? it seems that some are not inside the attachmeents directory

**Cursor**

You've hit an important point, and the output confirms your suspicion:
```
Warning: Media file 'a1f20af4-1a0f-4c1b-82dc-4c6bbf3894b9.png' from note data not found in attachments directory listing. It might be missing.
```
This indicates that the `deck_export_data` JSON refers to media files (e.g., `a1f20af4-1a0f-4c1b-82dc-4c6bbf3894b9.png`) that are *not* present in the `attachments.zip` (and thus not in the extracted `attachments/` directory).

The URLs like `https://cdn.ankipro.net/ankipro-prod/uploads/v2/attachment/deck_19357239/a6aedbc3-ba4a-4841-b8de-d074b9a651df.png` suggest these are hosted online.

**Solution: Download Missing Media**

Instead of solely relying on the `attachments/` directory, we can implement the following logic:

1.  **Prioritize Local Files**: When processing `note_attachments`, first check if the extracted filename (e.g., `a1f20af4-1a0f-4c1b-82dc-4c6bbf3894b9.png`) exists in the local `attachments_dir`. If yes, use that local path.
2.  **Download if Missing**: If the file is *not* found locally, attempt to download it from the `media_file.url`.
    *   The downloaded files should be saved into the `attachments_dir` (or a designated media download directory within `temp_dir`) to keep all media consolidated.
    *   The `media_files_paths` list (passed to `genanki.Package`) must contain the paths to these newly downloaded files as well.
    *   The `media_files_for_anki` list (used for checking `img_filename not in media_files_for_anki`) should also be updated with the names of downloaded files.

This requires the `requests` library for making HTTP requests. So, `pip install requests` will be needed.

Let's modify the script.

The script has been updated to include a `download_media` function using the `requests` library.

Key changes:
1.  **Import `requests`**: Added at the top.
2.  **`download_media(url, download_path)` function**:
    *   Takes a URL and a local path.
    *   Attempts to download the file.
    *   Returns `True` on success, `False` on failure.
3.  **Media Processing Logic in `process_ofc_file`**:
    *   **Create `attachments_dir`**: The script now ensures `attachments_dir` (e.g., `temp_dir/attachments/`) is created if it doesn't exist. This directory will store both unzipped and newly downloaded media.
    *   **Prioritize Local, then Download**:
        *   When a `media_url` is found for a note attachment:
            *   It constructs the `local_img_path` within `attachments_dir`.
            *   If `local_img_path` does *not* exist, it calls `download_media`.
            *   If downloaded successfully (or if it already existed), the file's path is added to `media_files_paths` (for `genanki`) and its basename to `media_files_for_anki` (for internal tracking/logging, though `media_files_paths` is the critical one for `genanki`).
            *   The `<img>` tag is only added to the card field if the local media file is confirmed to exist (either pre-existing or successfully downloaded).
    *   **Populate from Local First**: Before processing notes, the script now scans the `attachments_dir` (if it exists after unzipping or manual creation) to populate `media_files_paths` and `media_files_for_anki` with any initially present local files.
4.  **Hardcoded IDs**: I've replaced `random.randrange(...)` for `DEFAULT_MODEL_ID` and `DEFAULT_DECK_ID` with example hardcoded integer IDs (e.g., `1990849302`). You should generate your own unique IDs and use those for consistency if you plan to re-import or update decks.
5.  **Deck/Model ID per AnkiPro Deck**:
    *   The script now attempts to use `ap_deck_data.get("anki_deck_id")` for the deck ID. If not found, it falls back to `DEFAULT_DECK_ID`, and if that is still the generic default, it generates a new random ID for *that specific deck*. This provides better handling if the AnkiPro data itself contains multiple distinct decks with their own IDs.
    *   A similar placeholder logic for `current_model_id` is noted, but for now, it uses the global `ANKI_MODEL`. If your AnkiPro decks have truly different structures/models, this would need more sophisticated handling.
6.  **Consolidate Media Paths**: Before assigning to `anki_package.media_files`, the script now creates `unique_media_paths` using `sorted(list(set(media_files_paths)))` to avoid duplicates if a file was referenced multiple times or found locally and then re-processed.

**Before running:**

*   **Install `requests`**:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
*   **Replace Placeholder IDs**: If you want stable Model and Deck IDs for Anki, generate them once and put them in place of `1990849302` and `1700901984`.
    ```bash
    python -c "import random; print(random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31))"
    ```

The HTML warning `Field contained the following invalid HTML tags... < 5000 copies/cell` is because the less-than symbol `<` is being interpreted as the start of an HTML tag by `genanki`'s HTML linter. Since your content *is* HTML, this is a bit of a nuanced issue. If the content `... < 5000 ...` is meant to be literal text within a `<p>` tag, it *should* ideally be `&lt; 5000`. However, since AnkiPro is likely rendering this fine, and Anki itself is quite permissive with HTML in fields, this warning might be benign. If it causes rendering issues in Anki, then HTML escaping (`html.escape()`) would be needed for those specific text portions *before* they are embedded in the HTML structure. For now, the script assumes the input HTML is as intended.

This version should be more robust in handling media files. Let me know how your testing goes!

```shellscript
    pip install requests
```

```shellscript
    pip install requests
```

```shellscript
    python -c "import random; print(random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31))"
```

**User**

Good, but the cdn needs user agent to allow downloads. look at @get_img.py as reference

---

**Cursor**

You're absolutely correct. Many CDNs or web servers will block requests that don't have a common User-Agent header to prevent simple bots or scripts from scraping their content.

The `get_img.py` script clearly shows a working approach by including a `User-Agent` header:
```python
headers = {
    "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

We need to incorporate this into the `download_media` function in `ofc_to_apkg_converter.py`.

I'll define the same `headers` dictionary and use it in the `requests.get()` call.

```python
headers = {
    "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
}
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
```

```python
import requests  # Added for downloading media

# --- genanki Model and Deck IDs ---
# It's important to use unique IDs. Generate them once and hardcode them.
# python -c "import random; print(random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31))"
DEFAULT_MODEL_ID = 1990849302  # Example: random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31)
DEFAULT_DECK_ID = 1700901984  # Example: random.randrange(1 << 30, 1 << 31)

# Define a User-Agent header
REQUEST_HEADERS = {
    "user-agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/136.0.0.0 Safari/537.36",
}

ANKI_MODEL = genanki.Model(
    DEFAULT_MODEL_ID,
// ... existing code ...
def download_media(url, download_path):
    """Downloads a file from a URL to a given path."""
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, stream=True, headers=REQUEST_HEADERS) # Added headers
        response.raise_for_status()  # Raise an exception for HTTP errors
        with open(download_path, "wb") as f:
// ... existing code ...
```

Excellent catch! By adding the `REQUEST_HEADERS` with a common browser User-Agent string to the `requests.get()` call within the `download_media` function, the script should now be able to download media from the CDN successfully, just like your `get_img.py` script does.

This should significantly improve the media handling and reduce or eliminate the "Failed to download" warnings for legitimate media URLs.

---

**User**

also, always download, don't ever look inside attachments. remove all code relating to that

---

**Cursor**

Okay, understood. We will modify the script to *always* attempt to download media from the URLs provided in the `deck_export_data` and skip any logic related to `attachments.zip` or pre-existing local files in the `attachments/` directory.

The `attachments/` directory (within the `base_path` or `temp_dir`) will still be used as the destination for downloaded files.

Here are the changes:
1.  Remove the code that extracts `attachments.zip`.
2.  Remove the initial scan of `attachments_dir` for existing files.
3.  The loop processing `note_media_attachments` will now directly attempt to download each media file to the `attachments_dir`.

I'll apply these changes to `ofc_to_apkg_converter.py`.

The script `ofc_to_apkg_converter.py` has been updated as requested:

1.  **Removed `attachments.zip` Handling**: All code that specifically looked for, extracted, or processed `attachments.zip` has been removed.
2.  **Removed Local Scans**: The script no longer pre-scans the `attachments/` directory for existing media files before processing notes.
3.  **Always Download**: The media processing loop now *always* attempts to download the media file from the URL specified in `note_data`.
    *   If the download is successful, the file is saved to the `attachments_dir` (e.g., `temp_dir/attachments/`), its path is added to `media_files_paths`, and the `<img>` tag is added to the note.
    *   If the download fails, a warning is printed, and the image will be missing from the card.
4.  **`attachments_dir` Creation**: The `attachments_dir` is still created if it doesn't exist, as it serves as the unified download location for all media.
5.  **Commented out some verbose print statements** for media file paths and model/deck IDs during normal operation to make the output cleaner, but they can be easily uncommented for debugging.

This version streamlines the media handling to a download-only approach. The `.ofc` file itself is still unzipped to a temporary directory to access `deck_export_data` and `deck_export_metadata.json`, but its internal `attachments.zip` is now ignored.

**User**

There is still this warning. can I ignore it or should I fix it?

---

**Cursor**

The warning you're seeing:
```
/Users/andyye/miniconda3/lib/python3.11/site-packages/genanki/note.py:148: UserWarning: Field contained the following invalid HTML tags. Make sure you are calling html.escape() if your field data isn't already HTML-encoded: < 5000 copies/cell to 10^6 copies/cell</p> < 50 copies/ cell to 10^8 copies/cell</p>
  warnings.warn("Field contained the following invalid HTML tags. Make sure you are calling html.escape() if"
```
originates from the `genanki` library itself. It has a basic HTML linter that checks the content of your fields. When it encounters a less-than symbol (`<`) that isn't part of a recognized HTML tag, it issues this warning, suggesting you might need to use `html.escape()` (which would turn `<` into `&lt;`).

**Can you ignore it?**

*   **Usually, yes, for this specific case.** The content `... < 5000 copies/cell ...` is likely intended to be displayed as literal text (meaning "less than 5000 copies...").
*   Anki's rendering engine (which is based on web browser technology) is generally quite forgiving of minor HTML imperfections. It will most likely display `< 5000` correctly as text, even though it's not strictly valid HTML to have a bare `<` in that context if it's not starting a tag.
*   The AnkiPro export format itself provides this HTML, and presumably, it renders correctly in AnkiPro.

**Should you fix it?**

*   **For strict HTML validity and to silence the warning: Yes.** The "correct" way to represent a literal less-than sign in HTML is `&lt;`.
*   **If it causes rendering issues in Anki: Yes.** While unlikely for this specific case, sometimes such issues can lead to parts of the text being misinterpreted as broken HTML tags and not displaying as intended.
*   **If the warning bothers you: Yes.**

**How to fix it (if you choose to):**

You would need to selectively replace裸 `<` and `>` symbols that are *not* part of actual HTML tags with their HTML entities (`&lt;` and `&gt;`). This is a bit tricky because you don't want to break existing HTML tags like `<p>`, `<strong>`, `<img>`, etc.

A simple `html.escape()` on the entire field content would break all existing HTML structure, which is not what you want, as the content from AnkiPro is already HTML.

A more targeted approach using regular expressions could be:

```python
import html
import re

def selectively_escape_html_in_text(html_content):
    """
    Escapes < and > in text nodes, but not in tags.
    This is a simplified approach and might not cover all edge cases
    with complex HTML, especially with attributes containing < or >.
    """
    # This regex tries to find < or > that are likely part of text content
    # by looking at what's around them (not typical tag characters).
    # It's hard to make this perfect without a full HTML parser.
    # A common pattern is to replace < and > when they are surrounded by spaces
    # or alphanumeric characters, but not when they form part of a tag.

    # Simpler: replace < only if it's followed by a space and a number (for this specific warning)
    # This is very targeted to the warning you see.
    html_content = re.sub(r"<(\s*\d)", r"&lt;\1", html_content)
    # html_content = re.sub(r"(\d\s*)>", r"\1&gt;", html_content) # For '>' if it also becomes an issue

    return html_content

# ... inside your note processing loop ...
# front_content = fields.get("front_side", "")
# back_content = fields.get("back_side", "")

# Potentially apply selective escaping:
# front_content = selectively_escape_html_in_text(front_content)
# back_content = selectively_escape_html_in_text(back_content)
```

**Recommendation:**

1.  **Test First:** Import the generated `.apkg` into Anki. Check the cards that correspond to the warning (e.g., the one with `< 5000 copies/cell`).
2.  **If it Renders Correctly:** You can most likely ignore the warning. It's `genanki` being cautious.
3.  **If it Renders Incorrectly OR the Warning Annoys You:** Consider implementing a fix. The `re.sub(r"<(\s*\d)", r"&lt;\1", html_content)` approach is a minimal, targeted fix for the specific pattern shown in your warning (`< ` followed by a number). If other patterns cause warnings, the regex would need to be more general, which increases complexity and the risk of incorrectly modifying valid HTML tags.

Given that the data comes from an existing system (AnkiPro) and likely renders correctly there and in Anki, **I'd lean towards ignoring this specific `UserWarning` unless you observe actual rendering problems in Anki.**

The user-made changes (uncommenting `process_ofc_file` and commenting out `main()`, and reformatting `if temp_dir: shutil.rmtree(temp_dir)`) are for testing and don't affect the warning.

No code change is strictly necessary right now regarding this warning unless you want to be very thorough or are seeing issues.

**User**

Very cool. Do you think it's possible to do everything the python function does with javascript client-side so I don't have to create a backend? Do some research on the internet

---

**Cursor**

That's an interesting idea, moving the entire conversion process to client-side JavaScript! It would offer a serverless solution, which can be very appealing. Let's break down the feasibility by researching the necessary components.

**Core Tasks for Client-Side JavaScript:**

1.  **File Handling (Reading `.ofc`):**
    *   Users can select local `.ofc` files using an `<input type="file">` element. The File API can then be used to read its contents as an ArrayBuffer or Blob.
2.  **Unzipping (`.ofc` file and internal `attachments.zip` if we were using it):**
    *   Libraries like `JSZip` are excellent for handling zip files (creating, reading, modifying) in JavaScript. This is feasible.
3.  **Zstandard Decompression (for `deck_export_data`):**
    *   This is a significant challenge. Zstandard is a high-performance compression algorithm typically implemented in C/C++. For client-side JavaScript, we'd need a WebAssembly (WASM) port of a Zstandard decompression library.
4.  **JSON Parsing (metadata and deck data):**
    *   JavaScript handles JSON natively (`JSON.parse()`), so this is straightforward.
5.  **Downloading Media (from URLs):**
    *   The `fetch` API in JavaScript can be used to download files.
    *   **User-Agent Header:** Setting custom User-Agent headers with `fetch` in a browser environment is restricted for security reasons and generally not possible to the same extent as server-side. This could be a problem if the CDN strictly requires it. Proxies or serverless functions are sometimes used to circumvent this for client-side applications, but that reintroduces a backend component.
    *   **CORS:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing policies on the CDN server would need to allow requests from the domain where your JavaScript application is hosted. For public CDNs serving images, this is often (but not always) configured permissively.
6.  **Creating the `.apkg` file structure:**
    *   An `.apkg` file is a ZIP archive. Inside, the crucial components are:
        *   An SQLite database (`collection.anki2` or `collection.anki21`). This stores all the notes, cards, deck configurations, models, etc.
        *   A `media` file (JSON string) that maps numerical SCM (timestamp-based) filenames to the actual media filenames.
        *   A folder (also named `0`, `1`, `2`... corresponding to the media filenames) containing the actual media files.
    *   **SQLite Database Creation:** This is the *second major challenge*. Generating a fully structured SQLite database client-side requires a JavaScript SQLite library, typically one compiled to WebAssembly. `sql.js` is a popular choice. You would need to:
        *   Understand Anki's database schema in detail (tables like `notes`, `cards`, `col` (collection metadata), `models`, `decks`, etc.).
        *   Use `sql.js` to create these tables and populate them with the data extracted from the AnkiPro export.
    *   **Media File Handling:**
        *   Collect all downloaded media.
        *   Create the JSON `media` mapping file.
        *   Rename media files to their integer-based names for storage within the `.apkg`'s media directory.
    *   **Zipping it all into an `.apkg`:** `JSZip` can be used to create the final zip archive with the SQLite database and media files.
7.  **Offering the file for download:**
    *   Once the `.apkg` is generated in memory (as a Blob), JavaScript can trigger a download for the user.

I'll perform a web search focusing on "JavaScript Zstandard decompression WASM" and "JavaScript create Anki .apkg" or "sql.js Anki" to see what tools and examples might be available.

The research results are promising but also highlight the complexities:

**Positive Findings:**

*   **Zstandard Decompression (WASM):**
    *   Yes, there are WebAssembly ports of Zstandard. The search results show `zstd-wasm` by `bokuweb` and `fzstd` by `101arrowz`, and `@hpcc-js/wasm-zstd`. These libraries allow Zstandard decompression directly in the browser. This is a big plus.
        *   `zstd-wasm` (`@bokuweb/zstd-wasm`): Seems to be a direct Emscripten port and supports the simple API.
        *   `fzstd`: Claims high performance for a pure JavaScript implementation but notes that WASM ports are often faster for very large payloads. It's also very small.
        *   `@hpcc-js/wasm-zstd`: Another WASM wrapper.
*   **SQLite Database (WASM):**
    *   `sql.js` is a well-known library that compiles SQLite to WebAssembly, allowing you to create, open, and query SQLite databases entirely in JavaScript.
*   **Anki `.apkg` Generation in JavaScript:**
    *   The most exciting find is `krmanik/genanki-js`. This library is explicitly "A JavaScript implementation for generating Anki decks in browser client side."
    *   It states it uses `sql.js`, `FileSaver.js` (for triggering downloads), and `JSZip` (for creating the zip archive).
    *   This project directly addresses the most complex part: creating the Anki SQLite database structure and packaging it correctly.
*   **ZIP Handling:**
    *   `JSZip` is a mature library for this. `genanki-js` already uses it.

**Challenges and Considerations for Client-Side Conversion:**

1.  **Complexity of Anki's Database Schema:**
    *   While `genanki-js` likely handles this, Anki's database schema is non-trivial. It involves multiple interconnected tables (`col`, `notes`, `cards`, `decks`, `models`, `graves`, `tags`, etc.), specific data formats (like JSON for model and deck configuration within SQLite fields), and particular ID generation/linking schemes. Replicating all of this correctly from scratch would be a massive undertaking. Leveraging `genanki-js` would be essential to avoid this.
2.  **Media Downloading (User-Agent & CORS):**
    *   **User-Agent:** As discussed, setting a custom User-Agent header with `fetch` in the browser is generally not possible for security reasons. If the AnkiPro CDN strictly requires a specific User-Agent and blocks requests without it (or with the browser's default `fetch` User-Agent), downloads will fail. This is a potential major blocker for a *purely* client-side solution if the CDN is strict.
    *   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing):** The CDN must have permissive CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or specific to your app's domain) for `fetch` to succeed. If not, downloads will be blocked by the browser's same-origin policy.
3.  **Performance and Memory:**
    *   Decompressing files, especially large Zstandard streams, and manipulating potentially large SQLite databases in memory (even with WASM) can be resource-intensive for the user's browser, especially on less powerful devices or with very large decks.
    *   WASM helps significantly, but it's not magic. Large operations might still lead to a sluggish UI or high memory consumption. `genanki-js` and the WASM Zstandard libraries would need to be efficient.
4.  **Error Handling and User Feedback:**
    *   Robust error handling (e.g., failed downloads, malformed input files, decompression errors, issues with `genanki-js`) and clear user feedback would be crucial in a client-side application.
5.  **Dependency Management and Build Process:**
    *   You'd need to manage these JavaScript dependencies (JSZip, a Zstandard WASM library, sql.js, potentially genanki-js itself) and likely use a bundler like Webpack or Parcel to manage the WASM files and create an optimized application. `genanki-js` mentions needing to configure `locateFile` for `sql-wasm.wasm` if it's not in the same folder.

**Feasibility Assessment:**

*   **Technically Possible? Yes, with caveats.** The existence of `genanki-js` is a huge enabler, as it aims to solve the Anki package creation part. WASM libraries for Zstandard also exist.
*   **Practical? It depends heavily on:**
    1.  **The AnkiPro CDN's behavior regarding User-Agent and CORS for media downloads.** This is the biggest potential showstopper for a *purely* client-side approach. If downloads fail due to these restrictions, you'd need a proxy server (even a simple serverless function) to fetch the media, which negates the "no backend" goal for that part.
    2.  **The maturity and feature-completeness of `genanki-js`** for your specific needs (e.g., how well it handles the fields, HTML, and GUIDs from your AnkiPro data). You'd essentially be reimplementing the data extraction and mapping logic from your Python script into JavaScript, then feeding it to `genanki-js`.
    3.  **The size of the `.ofc` files and the number of media files.** Very large inputs could strain browser resources.

**Conclusion:**

While the core components exist to attempt a client-side JavaScript solution (especially leveraging `genanki-js` and a Zstandard WASM library), **the media downloading part (User-Agent/CORS) is the most significant risk that could force a partial backend component (like a proxy).**

The complexity of correctly populating Anki's SQLite database is substantial, so `genanki-js` is your best bet for that. You would need to:

1.  Read and unzip the `.ofc` file using `JSZip`.
2.  Decompress `deck_export_data` using a Zstandard WASM library.
3.  Parse the JSON.
4.  For each note and its media:
    *   Attempt to `fetch` the media. This is where User-Agent/CORS issues might arise.
    *   If successful, store the media (e.g., as Blobs).
5.  Transform the AnkiPro note data into the format expected by `genanki-js` (models, fields, notes).
6.  Use `genanki-js` to construct the Anki package, providing it with the notes and media data.
7.  Trigger a download of the resulting `.apkg` Blob.

It's a significantly more complex undertaking than the Python script due to the browser environment's limitations and the need to manage WASM components, but it's not entirely out of the realm of possibility if the media download hurdle can be overcome and `genanki-js` fits your requirements.

I would recommend a small proof-of-concept focusing on:
1.  Unzipping the `.ofc`.
2.  Decompressing `deck_export_data` with a WASM Zstd library.
3.  Attempting to download a few media files from the CDN URLs using `fetch` to see if User-Agent/CORS issues block you.

If media downloads work, then exploring `genanki-js` integration would be the next big step.

write a quick python code to check if anki has cors protection

---

**Cursor**

Okay, I can write a Python script to help you check for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) headers from a specific URL, like one of the AnkiPro CDN URLs.

This script will send an `OPTIONS` request (a "preflight" request that browsers use to check CORS permissions) to the URL and include an `Origin` header. It will then print any relevant `Access-Control-*` headers it receives in the response.

Here's the script:


```python
import requests

def check_cors(url, origin="https://example.com"):
    """
    Checks for CORS headers from a given URL by sending an OPTIONS request.

    Args:
        url (str): The URL to check.
        origin (str): The Origin header to send with the request.
    """
    print(f"Checking CORS for URL: {url}")
    print(f"Simulating request from Origin: {origin}\n")

    headers = {
        "Origin": origin,
        "Access-Control-Request-Method": "GET",  # Common method to request
        "User-Agent": "Python CORS Check Script" # Good practice to have a User-Agent
    }

    try:
        response = requests.options(url, headers=headers, timeout=10, allow_redirects=True)
        print(f"Status Code: {response.status_code}")
        print("\nResponse Headers:")
        for header, value in response.headers.items():
            print(f"  {header}: {value}")

        print("\nCORS-specific headers found:")
        acao = response.headers.get("Access-Control-Allow-Origin")
        acam = response.headers.get("Access-Control-Allow-Methods")
        acah = response.headers.get("Access-Control-Allow-Headers")
        acac = response.headers.get("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials")
        acme = response.headers.get("Access-Control-Max-Age")

        if acao:
            print(f"  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: {acao}")
            if acao == "*" :
                print("    Interpretation: Allows requests from any origin.")
            elif acao == origin:
                print(f"    Interpretation: Allows requests specifically from your origin ('{origin}').")
            else:
                print("    Interpretation: Allows requests from a specific origin, but it's NOT your simulated origin or wildcard.")
        else:
            print("  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: NOT FOUND (This likely means CORS is not enabled for this origin/request)")

        if acam:
            print(f"  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: {acam}")
        else:
            print("  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: NOT FOUND")

        if acah:
            print(f"  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: {acah}")
        else:
            print("  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: NOT FOUND")
            
        if acac:
            print(f"  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: {acac}")
        else:
            print("  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: NOT FOUND (Often omitted if not needed)")

        if acme:
            print(f"  Access-Control-Max-Age: {acme}")
        else:
            print("  Access-Control-Max-Age: NOT FOUND (Optional)")


    except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
        print(f"Timeout when trying to reach {url}")
    except requests.exceptions.ConnectionError:
        print(f"Connection error when trying to reach {url}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Replace with the actual AnkiPro CDN URL you want to test
    # test_url = "https://cdn.ankipro.net/ankipro-prod/uploads/v2/attachment/deck_19357239/a6aedbc3-ba4a-4841-b8de-d074b9a651df.png"

    # You can change the simulated_origin to something like "http://localhost:3000" 
    # if you plan to test from a local development server.
    simulated_origin = "https://www.example-converter.com" 

    check_cors(test_url, origin=simulated_origin)
```

I've created the `check_cors.py` script.

**How it works:**

1.  **`check_cors(url, origin)` function:**
    *   Takes the `url` of the resource (e.g., an image on the CDN) and a `simulated_origin` string.
    *   It constructs headers for an `OPTIONS` request:
        *   `Origin`: Set to your `simulated_origin`. This tells the server where the hypothetical cross-origin request is coming from.
        *   `Access-Control-Request-Method`: Typically `GET` for images.
        *   `User-Agent`: It's good practice to include one.
    *   It sends the `OPTIONS` request using `requests.options()`.
    *   It then prints the status code and all response headers.
    *   Finally, it specifically looks for and interprets common CORS headers:
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`: This is the most important one. It tells you if your `simulated_origin` (or `*` for any origin) is allowed.
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Methods`: Shows which HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) are allowed.
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Headers`: Shows which request headers are allowed.
        *   `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials`: Indicates if credentials (like cookies) can be sent.
        *   `Access-Control-Max-Age`: How long the results of a preflight request can be cached.

**To use it:**

1.  **Save the code:** Save the code above as `check_cors.py`.
2.  **Install `requests`** if you haven't already:
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
3.  **Modify `test_url`**: Change the `test_url` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to one of the actual AnkiPro CDN URLs you want to test (I've put one of your examples there).
4.  **Modify `simulated_origin` (Optional but Recommended)**:
    *   Change `simulated_origin` to the domain where your JavaScript application would eventually be hosted (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for local development, or `https://your-app-domain.com` for a deployed app). This makes the test more realistic. I've used `https://www.example-converter.com` as a placeholder.
5.  **Run the script:**
    ```bash
    python check_cors.py
    ```

**Interpreting the Output:**

*   **Key Header: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`**
    *   If it's `*`: Good news! The server allows requests from any origin.
    *   If it matches your `simulated_origin`: Good news! The server allows requests from your specific domain.
    *   If it's a *different specific domain*: Bad news for your `simulated_origin`. Your domain isn't explicitly allowed.
    *   If it's **NOT FOUND**: This usually means CORS is not set up to allow your `simulated_origin` for the requested resource/method. Preflight requests might even get a non-2xx status code (like a 403 or 404) if not handled or explicitly denied.

This script will give you a good indication of whether the AnkiPro CDN is configured to allow cross-origin requests from a web browser for the type of access your client-side JavaScript would need. Remember that this Python script isn't subject to browser CORS rules itself; it's merely inspecting the server's response headers to see *how a browser would be treated*.

```shellscript
    pip install requests
```

```shellscript
    python check_cors.py
```

---

**User**

I think the cdn does not have any cors problems am I right?

---

**Cursor**

Yes, you are absolutely right!

The output from your `check_cors.py` script:
```
CORS-specific headers found:
  Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
    Interpretation: Allows requests from any origin.
  Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, MOVE, OPTIONS, GET
  Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *, DNT,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Content-Type, Expires
  Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: NOT FOUND (Often omitted if not needed)
  Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400
```
is excellent news for a client-side JavaScript approach.

Specifically:

1.  **`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`**: This is the most important part. The asterisk `*` means the server (AnkiPro's CDN in this case) allows requests from **any origin** (any domain). Your JavaScript application, regardless of where it's hosted, will be permitted by CORS policy to make `fetch` requests to these CDN URLs.
2.  **`Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, POST, PUT, DELETE, MOVE, OPTIONS, GET`**: This indicates that `GET` requests (which you'd use for downloading images) are allowed.
3.  **`Access-Control-Allow-Headers: *, DNT,X-CustomHeader,Keep-Alive,User-Agent,X-Requested-With,If-Modified-Since,Content-Type, Expires`**: This shows a very permissive set of allowed request headers. The `*` here is also very generous. Critically, for your previous concern, it even lists `User-Agent` as an allowed header. However, it's important to remember that *browsers* typically restrict programmatic setting of the `User-Agent` header in `fetch` requests for security reasons. The server *allowing* it doesn't mean the browser will *send* a custom one you set via `fetch`. But the good news is, with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, the browser's default `User-Agent` (or lack thereof for a simple `fetch`) should be fine. The CDN isn't strictly filtering on it if it's allowing all origins.

**Conclusion:**

Based on these headers, the AnkiPro CDN is openly configured for cross-origin access. This significantly increases the viability of a purely client-side JavaScript solution because you shouldn't encounter CORS-related blockages when your JavaScript tries to `fetch` the media files.

The main challenges remaining for a client-side solution would be:

*   Integrating and using a Zstandard WASM library for decompressing `deck_export_data`.
*   Using a library like `genanki-js` (which uses `sql.js` and `JSZip`) to correctly construct the Anki SQLite database and package the `.apkg` file.
*   Managing the overall complexity and user experience in the browser.

But the CORS hurdle, which is often a major one, seems to be cleared!
